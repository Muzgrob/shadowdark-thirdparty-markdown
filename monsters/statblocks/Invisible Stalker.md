_Intelligent creatures made of flowing air. Often bound to the bidding of evil sorcerers for their peerless tracking ability._

**AC** 13, **HP** 29, **ATK** 3 pummel +4 (1d6), **MV** near (fly), **S** +2, **D** +3, **C** +2, **I** +2, **W** +1, **Ch** +0, **AL** N, **LV** 6

**Bound**. A secret, mundane contingency (such as the touch of a feather) ends the invisible stalker's magical servitude. 

**Invisible.** Naturally invisible. 

**Tracking.** Can always sense the direction of its chosen quarry.
